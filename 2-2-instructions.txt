--- Part Two ---

There are two boxes with IDs that meet the following criteria: 

The boxes will have IDs which differ by exactly one character at the same position in both strings.


**To get the puzzle answer:**
-------------------------

What (string of?) letters are common between the two correct box IDs?

(In the example below, this is found by removing the differing character from either ID, producing 'fgij'.)


For example, given the following box IDs:

abcde
fghij
klmno
pqrst
fguij
axcye
wvxyz

The IDs 'abcde' and 'axcye' are similar, but differ by two characters: the second(b/x) and fourth(d/y).

The IDs 'fghij' and 'fguij' differ by exactly one character: the third (h/u). Therefore those must be the correct pair of boxes.
